// Accelerator and brake, hooked where only a vehicle can reach them.

// San Andreas drives with W and S. VCS reads the accelerator from CPad::CROSS
// and the brake from CPad::SQUARE, and on foot those same two buttons sprint
// and jump -- so binding W and S to them at the input layer would make the
// player sprint while walking forward and jump while walking backward.
//
// The way out is that the two functions hooked here are the vehicle's own
// accessors: nothing on foot calls them. Feeding the host keys in at that point
// makes W accelerate and S brake inside a car while leaving both keys as plain
// analog movement everywhere else, without the host ever having to ask the
// guest whether the player is driving.

// Addresses, found with ThirteenAG's own byte patterns against our EBOOT and
// cross-checked against the camera hook he resolves to 0x0898E098:
//
//   0x0898D2D8  accelerator, returns CROSS  (pad offset 0x2A) when enabled
//   0x0898D140  brake,       returns SQUARE (pad offset 0x26) when enabled
//
// Both are edited in generated_unit_0098.cpp, next to the camera hook.

// Pad field the accelerator reads: CROSS normally, RIGHTSHOULDER1 under the
// modern scheme. Byte offset into CPad, for aot_load16.
