// stick, so there is no register a mouse or a right stick could arrive in.
// ThirteenAG's WidescreenFixesPack solves this on real hardware by rewriting
// those two calls in the game's code (the DualAnalogPatch, itself after
// TheFloW's remastered controls); this port does the same thing in the AOT
// output, in generated_unit_0098.cpp around 0x0898E098.
//
// Kept in its own header so the one edit inside generated/ stays a pair of
// small, obvious calls rather than anything that has to be understood.

// out of that window, both axes would stop responding at once and only come
// back on the way down -- which is exactly the reported symptom. Reports each
// distinct value once, under PSPRECOMP_CAMERA_DIAG, so pitching up and reading
// the log answers it instead of another guess.

// PSPRECOMP_CAMERA_DIAG this prints a periodic tally: if the axis reads stop
// being reached while the player is still moving the mouse, some branch above
// diverted; if they keep being reached with live values and the view does not
// move, the input arrives and is discarded further down.
